          I'm Eva Liu!
        </p>
        <p>
          A software engineer who loves building tools that make complex things simpler.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve led projects like the Antimony Web Editor, a web app that helps researchers build biological models more easily, and contributed to the Vscode-Antimony extension, supporting over a thousand users.
        </p>
        <p>
          I co-authored a peer-reviewed paper in Bioinformatics about our work improving modeling tools in systems biology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it’s writing full-stack code, speaking at conferences, or building fun side projects like Pet My Dog, I’m all about creating tech that’s useful and thoughtful.
